About git
----------

We will use git mainly as a fast way to share code and update it. So basc knowledge should be enough.
As for the windows users, I never used git on windows, but the software available under this link seems to provide the necessary capabilities:

Some useful git comands:

- git status	
	shows the status of your files in your repository, for example whether it is up to date with the repository, or what your uncommitted files are

- git update
	updates your local repostory

- git add
	adds changed files to be committed. Add entire folders with "folder/*"

- git commit
	commits added changes which are to be pushed later. For us it is probably not necessary to put detailed commit-messages.

- git push (master/origin)
	pushed your committed (local) changes to the repository

- ".gitignore"
	.gitignore is a hidden file, in which you can define what kind of files are to be ignored by git, and thus not shown in "git status", for example "*.bin" or "test/*"
